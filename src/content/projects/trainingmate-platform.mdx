## System Architecture

### Client-Server Architecture
Designed a distributed system with:
- **Central Server**: Coordination and management of all training sessions
- **Instructor Client**: Command and control interface for training supervisors
- **Trainee Clients**: Individual workstation applications for participants
- **Network Layer**: Optimized TCP/IP communications for real-time data

### Core Technologies
- **C# .NET Framework**: Robust application development platform
- **Windows Forms**: Rich desktop user interface
- **WinAPI**: Low-level screen capture and system integration
- **Network Programming**: Custom protocols for real-time communication

## Key Features

### Real-time Screen Monitoring

**Multi-Screen Capture System**
```csharp
public class ScreenCaptureManager
{
    private readonly Dictionary<int, CaptureSession> _activeSessions;
    private readonly NetworkManager _networkManager;
    
    public async Task StartMonitoring(List<int> clientIds)
    {
        foreach (var clientId in clientIds)
        {
            var session = new CaptureSession(clientId);
            _activeSessions[clientId] = session;
            
            // Start capture with optimized compression
            await session.StartCapture(
                compressionLevel: CompressionLevel.Optimal,
                frameRate: 15,
                quality: CaptureQuality.High
            );
        }
    }
    
    private async Task ProcessScreenData(byte[] screenData, int clientId)
    {
        // Compress and transmit screen data
        var compressed = await CompressScreenData(screenData);
        await _networkManager.SendToInstructor(compressed, clientId);
    }
}
```

### Interactive Whiteboard System

```csharp
public class WhiteboardManager
{
    private readonly Canvas _canvas;
    private readonly NetworkSynchronizer _sync;
    
    public void HandleDrawingEvent(DrawingEvent evt)
    {
        // Apply drawing locally
        _canvas.AddDrawingElement(evt.Element);
        
        // Synchronize with other participants
        _sync.BroadcastDrawingEvent(evt);
        
        // Store for session recording
        _sessionRecorder.RecordEvent(evt);
    }
}
```

        var compressionLevel = CalculateOptimalCompression(
            parameters.AvailableBandwidth,
            parameters.ParticipantCount,
            parameters.QualityRequirements
        );
